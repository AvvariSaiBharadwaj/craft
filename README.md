# Custom Resource Abstraction Fabrication Tool

CRAFT removes the language barrier to create Kubernetes Operators. CRAFT declares Kubernetes Operators in a robust and generic way for any resource, letting developers focus on CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations of resource management in a Dockerfile. With CRAFT you can create operators without a dependent layer and in the language of your choice!

## Features:

1. Automated reconciliation using Docker entrypoint exit codes.
2. Kubernetes structural schema validation for a custom resource (CRD) happens within CRAFT while creating an operator.
3. Craft can be installed as a binary tool. 

These features allow CRAFT to achieve the objectives listed in this [Kubernetes Architecture Design Proposal.](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/declarative-application-management.md#bespoke-application-deployment)

## Demo:
As an example, we have created [wordpress operator](https://opensource.salesforce.com/craft/tutorial/index.html) that is comparable to one provided by [Presslabs](https://github.com/presslabs/wordpress-operator)

## Advantages
1. **Easy onboarding** : Create an operator in your language of choice.
2. **Segregation of duties** : Developers can work in the docker file while the Site Reliability or DevOps engineer can declaratively configure the operator.
3. **Control access** : Control which users have access to the operator resources.
4. **Versioning and API interface** : Work on a different version of the operator or resource than your users.
5. **Save time** : Get schema and input validation feedback before runtime.
6. **Automated reconciliation** : Automate resource reconciliation to lower your maintenance workload.
7. **Dependent teams work independently** : Dependent teams can automate independently and create abstraction layers on top of your abstraction.

## Built with
CRAFT is built with open source projects Kubebuilder and Operatify:

1. [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) : CRAFT augments the operator skeleton generated by Kubebuilder with custom resource definitions and controller capabilities.
2. [Operatify](https://github.com/operatify/operatify) : CRAFT leverages Operatifyâ€™s automated reconciliation capabilities. Our inspiration is this [blog post](https://www.stephenzoio.com/kubernetes-operators-for-resource-management/), where we have realized that we can overcome the last barrier to declaratively create operators.
